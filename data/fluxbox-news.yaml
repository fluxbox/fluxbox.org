  title: "Fluxconf2015 - Genesis of the 'There is no cabal!'"
  author: Mathias
  markup: markdown

    Much to the surprise of MOST (I think, ALL except two) fluxboxers on the
    planet, a HUGE conference took place on 2015-08-13 in Heidelberg:

    **Fluxconf2015!**

    In case you missed the conference or were too late to grab the gold
    tickets: You next chance will be in 2025, Fluxconf takes place only once 
    in 10 years. If the moon is at the right position.

    Right now, in Heidelberg / Germany, <a href="">DebConf2015</a> is taking 
    place. A nice dude, who travels under the name "Paul â˜ƒ Tagliamonte", 
    happens to be there, for some 
    <a href="https://portfolio.debian.net/result?email=paultag%40debian.org">absolutely</a> 
    <a href="https://pault.ag/">unrelated</a>
    <a href="http://opensource.org/docs/board-annotated#PaulTagliamonte">reason</a>.

    Coincidentally, yours truly had things to do in Bonn / Germany, which is
    relativly close to DebConf2015. So, in some kind of spontaneous mood, we
    decided to just meet in person in Heidelberg.

    Time was crucial and very limited. We managed to pack a lot of things into
    the little we had: a keynote, several talks, a BoF regarding version 
    numbers, evil master plans and a lot  more. And 
    <a href="https://twitter.com/paultag/status/631854563243524096">beer</a>.
    Obviously.

    Sadly, we were too drunk and/or jetlagged (Paul was up 24hours already when
    I arrived at his location) to take any pictures. So, you have to take my
    word for it: it was great!

  title: "Fluxbox 1.3.7 - Bam! Zero Bugs!!11!"
  author: The Fluxbox team
  markup: markdown
  content: |+

    To release 1.3.6 ~ a month ago was a great success: A lot of you, our
    users, who rarely run bleeding edge fluxbox.git, were confronted with
    what was hidden in the git repository for almost 2 years. Due to the
    lack of testing power there was no other way to get "massive"
    feedback.  1.3.6 generated the feedback we needed to make 1.3.7. There
    will be bugs, obviously, but we think 1.3.7 is in pretty good shape.
    Without further ado:

    Critical Bugfixes:

    * Segfault on startup (mostly *BSD)
    * Segfault on shutdown
    * Segfault on clicking the Remember menu
    * Menu crops on TypeAhead

    Minor Bugfixes:

    * \_NET\_REQUEST\_FRAME\_EXTENTS
    * Working autorepeat keys
    * Working vertical rotated Tabs and Toolbar
    * Proper size of titlebar buttons on restart / detaching tabs
    * Missing windowmenu works again
    * Several glitches in the menu
    * Correct handling of 'maximized' statement in the apps file

    Features:

    * The improved TypeAhead sytem is not limited to matches on beginning
      of menu items anymore, the behavior is configurable:
      * Nowhere - disables TypeAhead support
      * ItemStart - matches typed text only at the start of a menu item
      * Somewhere - matches typed text somewhere in a menu item
        (Currently this is a configfile-only option)

    * Minor tweaks to the i18n system
    * Updated turkish translations

    End User unrelated:

    * Code refactoring and cleanup, assisted by Coverity and
      clang static code analysis

    is one option.

  author: The Fluxbox team
  markup: markdown
  content: |+

    A nasty, little bug went undiscovered into 1.3.3 and prevented the logic
    commands from working. So, if you happen to use any of the logic commands
    like 'if', 'and' or .. well .. 'or' in your keys-file: This is the release
    that fixes that for you. Nothing else was added or fixed.

    Sorry for the inconvinience!

    New year, new release. Since the fluxbox-1.3.4 contained a few rather nasty
    bugs (some have labeled it "unlucky release" :)), here is the 100% bug free
    version you should use from now on. No more time holes, sorry folks.

    General:

    * Added 'LHalf' / 'RHalf' titlebar buttons
    * Added 'ClientPatternTest' command for testing clientpatterns via
      fluxbox-remote
    * Added 'he_IL' translations

    Critical Bugfixes in 1.3.4:

    * All timer based problems are fixed now
    * Fixed integer overflows for some gradient textures
    * Fixed compile issue on MacOS

    Other Bugfixes:

    * Correct renderinger of 'sunken' textures
    * Move windows without the lagging-behind-effect on slower machines
    * Improved color brightening in textures
    * Memory and other code improvements in texture rendering code
    * Fix build-system issues

    * Added option to revert focus to previous window only on current head in a multi-monitor setup
    * Rewrite of FbTk::TextureRenderer (simpler code)
    * Improved building on Microsoft Windows

  content: |+

    Today the fluxbox team is very happy to announce a new release of fluxbox 1.3.2

    After a very successful participation in GSOC2011 (we will report more soonish)
    and right before we are starting our (slow turning, point taken) engines to 
    integrate the result of the two GSOC2011 projects into the main line (which might
    be a bit bumpy), we wanted something more stable for you.

    Both Pavel and Gediminas, our GSOC2011 participants, contributed to this release
    all over the place. Most notably, Gediminas added ARGB32 visuals to fluxbox (so, yes, your 
    cairo-dock now looks awesome again). And Gediminas cleaned up some gory old code
    mess and fixed some crashes along the road.

    So, happy release and happy fluxboxing!

    ![GSOC Logo][lgsoc]

    Your beloved and trusted windowmanager got accepted as a mentoring
    organization on the [Google-Summer of Code][gsoc]. For those of you
    living under a rock, I will briefly describe the general idea of
    GSOC:

        You work fulltime on a fluxbox related project over the summer
        and get paid by Google. Yes, paid. Money.

    At the moment we are working on filling out some related paper work
    (eg, application templates), but you can have a look at some
    [project ideas][fsoc] we have. You can read more about the next steps
    for you and us at [Google's blog][bgsoc].

    This is the first time we tried to become part of SOC and we are very
    happy to see this happen.

  title: Just as promised... 1.3.1!
  author: Mathias
  markup: markdown
  content: |+
    Getting the 1.3.0 out of the door brought up some hidden bugs, we tried
    hard to catch most of them in the last week. Since that went very well,
    we have a new release for you:

    Critical Bugfixes:

    * Fix for not hiding submenus if menuDelay is set.
    * Fix crash when moving transient windows (Dialogs) between Workspaces,
      #3088856.
    * Fix crash when SystemTray was rotated 90/270 degree, #3188223.
    * Fix potential crash when gettting an UnmapEvent before a FocusEvent.
    * Fix potential crash on accessing NULL-pointer.

    Other Bugfixes:

    * Fix wrong width calculation of Systemtray, #3150939.
    * Fix initial placement of WindowMenu, #2731524.
    * Fix incorrectly shown alpha values in Menus, #3187373.
    * Fix render 'sunken' Textures correctly.

    Personal note from Mathias: This is the first time 'fluxgen' was not
    able to get this release out of the door himself. He has injured himself
    by trying something a real hacker should never be allowed: Leave the
    keyboard. So, best whishes from here towards Henrik!

  title: You didn't see that coming, did you?
  author: The Fluxbox Team
  markup: markdown
  content: |+
    Fluxbox 1.3 has arrived! A long long long time is over, and we finally
    decided to make a release.

    * Added support for bidirectional text, #2801836.
    * Allow to override 'Focus New Windows' via .fluxbox/apps
    * New actions:
      * ActivateTab
      * ArrangeWindowsVertical
    * New 'MoveN' and 'ClickN' action support for keys file
    * New focus model 'StrictMouseFocus'. This will affect focus when
      closing, moving, lowering windows, changing desktops, etc, whereas the
      'MouseFocus' model will only change focus when you move the mouse.
    * New "background: unset" property for use in overlays.
    * Allowing relative paths for background images in style files.
    * Allowing matching screen number in ClientPattern.
    * Removed rootcommand from init, as fbsetbg is run automatically nowadays.
    * Removed line style resources from init file.

    In any case, we hope to get more into the 'flux' way of doing things, aka
    release early and often. So, have fun with this release.

    Personal note from Mathias: This one is dedicated to the first official
    'fluxbaby' on the planet: my daughter Karo, born on 6th of November 2010.
    Which is, btw, the birthday of Henrik as well :)

    No, we are not dead :) Behind the scenes we are hunting those ugly, nasty

    be "Type-Ahead":http://www.mozilla.org/access/type-ahead/ for the menu
    pretty soon. Another idea already tested by some brave folks from
    \#fluxbox is the "CommandTool":http://darkshed.net/paste/shot-2005-03-17-144707-1024-768.jpg,
    kind of fluxbox-commandline for the toolbar. Simon is currently busy with bringing fluxbox's hunger 
    for memory down, still some issues to solve but it looks very promising so far.
    Our little "fbot":http://core.fluxbox.org/~fbot/ has a new home: core.fluxbox.org, 
    big thanx to 'car' who 'gave' us that box. I made some "WebButtons":http://darkshed.net/news/29/fluxbox-buttons-- 
    you can freeely use to show the world that you are a fluxboxer :) 
    And maybe there are some more things coming up, running secretly behind the scenes ... stay tuned!

  author: Mathias

    <p>Hello folks, </p>
    <p> as many of you know (or not): The current manpage of fluxbox is a bit
    behind whats currently inside fluxbox and thus, it needs a
    facelifting, refreshing and shiny new colors. Curt Micol, widely known
    as Asenchi, has started a tiny subproject, called "newfluxman":
    <br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.asenchi.com/misc/newfluxman.txt">http://www.asenchi.com/misc/newfluxman.txt</a>
    <br><br>
    Thats actually what he has written so far. We (the fluxboxteam) would
    like to encourage anyone of you, who is interested in contributing to
    that new manpage, to write ideas, thoughts, sections and whatnot to
    <br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;asenchi [ta] asenchi [tod] com&gt;

  title: Repository Changes
  author: Mathias
  content: |+
    Hi Folks,

    At the moment we are moving the our cvs-repository from sourceforge.net to
    a subversion based repository at <a
        href="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/fluxbox/">berlios.de</a>.  We are doing this for
    serveral reasons:

    <ul>
        <li>subversion is a pretty nice cvs-replacement with several
        advantages</li>
        <li>recurring problems with the cvs-repository hosted on sf.net
            <ul>
                <li>speed</li>
                <li>anonymous cvs is hours behind developer cvs</li>
                <li>reliability</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    The fluxbox.org site will remain hosted at sf.net along with the
    bugtracker, only the cvs-repository will be moving.

    For those that may be afraid of learning yet another tool, we believe you
    will find <a href="subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a> to be similar to cvs in usage considering the interface,
    but faster and friendlier as a whole.

    Thank you for your patience in this move.

    I'm using fluxbox-0.9.10-r2 and boy does it look good! What I'd like to
    know, is how to use icons in the menu. It would seem that you create
    ~/.fluxbox/icons and put .xpm icons into that folder named aterm.xpm,
    xmms.xpm etc.
    <br><br>

    This doesn't work out-of-the-box, and someone on forums.gentoo.org

  title: Fluxbox and gnome-settings-daemon (SOLVED)
  author: aleczapka
  content: |+
    Several people have sent info about <a href="http://www.muhri.net/nav.php3?node=gts">gtk+/gtk2 theme switcher</a>, which does exacly the job. <a href="mailto:fopref&#64;lanrules.de">Johannes Jordan</a> wrote a very helpfull answer:
    <blockquote>
    As asked for in the news, I want to give you a hopefully helping answer.
    <br><br>

    I think what you mean is how to select a nice looking theme for gtk+(2)
    without gnome 2. themes are everything about the look of gtk+.
    <br><br.

    There is a tool called Gtk Theme Switch. It's website is
    <a href="http://www.muhri.net/nav.php3?node=gts">http://www.muhri.net/nav.php3?node=gts</a>.
    <br><br>

    It works in the command line but also has a nice minimalistic GUI.
    <br><br>

    It is available as 'gtk-theme-switch' debian package. In the testing and
    the unstable branch, it is already up to date and capable of switching
    gtk2 themes (command switch2 for this). in stable branch, there is an
    older version only supporting gtk1.
    <br><br>

    If you want to do it yourself, you can edit the .gtkrc-2.0 file in your
    home directory. it can be written like a theme file (every gtk theme is
    a gtkrc file, most themes use a so called theme engine - the gtkrc
    file tells to load the specific lib) and it can also have an include
    command for the gtkrc of an installed theme. mine look like follows:
    <pre>
    # --
    include "/usr/share/themes/ThinIce/gtk-2.0/gtkrc"
    # --
    </pre>
    <br>

    There IS another command available to load themes (telling only the name
    without the path etc., i.e. "ThinIce"), but I can't remember it now.
    <br><br>

    If you want to change stuff declared (or even not declared) in the
    theme's gtkrc without editing the theme (which could be overwritten on
    updates etc) you can add this to your .gtkrc-2.0 after the include as
    well. good thing for using another font...
    <br><br>
    </blockquote>

    <a href="mailto:roman&#64;isoTree.com">Roman Meytin</a> adds: You
    If you use gentoo you can <code>'emerge x11-themes/gtk-theme-switch'</code>.
    You can also use 'qtconfig,' which I believe comes with QT to perform
    similar actions on QT/KDE applications.
    <br><br>
    Thanks all for the quick answers.

    <a href="mailto:torn&#64;autistici.org">Torn asks</a>: <i>I was reading the <a href="/docs/en/faq.php">fluxbox faq</a> and found what I was looking for:<br>
    <b>Q</b>: Gtk2/Gnome2 applications look wired under Fluxbox, but they look ok
    when gnome is started<br>
    <b>A</b>: Run gnome-settings-daemon when Fluxbox starts, eg. put this into your
    ~/.xinitrc
    <br><br>

    Well, it works, but I'm using and enjoying fluxbox exactly because it
    doesn't require tons of libraries and tools I just don't need. I want
    just a bar and a menu, nothing less, nothing more.
    <br><br>

    I'm using debian, and installing gnome-control-center (which contains
    the settings-daemon) requires me to install more then 30 other packages!
    I was wondering if exists another tool like gnome-setting-daemon, or an
    hack to simulate it, in order to get gtk2 apps look nice without
    installing loads of unuseful things.
    <br><br>

    Thank you in advance, and keep on the good work, fluxbox rocks. </i>

  author: aleczapka
  content: |+
    Ever wondered where is Fluxbox development going to? Good, cause Henrik just posted a message on our mailing list, about Fluxbox bright future.
    <br><br>

    <b>Fluxbox Next Generation Features:</b>
    <ul>
    <li>Layer support ("always on top") [high priority]
    <br><br>

    <li>Action system [high priority]<br>
        You will be able to specify actions for things like button click
        (thus overriding default actions)
    <br><br>

    <li>Transparent windows [low priority]<br>
        Configurable both compile time and runtime.
    <br><br>

    <li>RANDR support [low priority]<br>
        <a href="http://www.xfree86.org/~keithp/talks/randr/randr/">The X Resize and Rotate Extension</a>
    <br><br>

    <li>Tabs embedded in title bar. [high priority]<br>
        Instead of having them outside the window they will be inside the
        title bar, thus giving you even more desktop space.
    </ul>

    Except for these basic features there'll be some new unique features and
    surprises.<br>

    Due to these major changes in the code there will be a "beta" release
    around the end of January and beginning of February, in which you can
    bug test and evaluate it.
    The release is sheduled at the end of February or beginning of March.
    <br><br>

    During this time, there might also be a bug fix release/patch for 0.1.14.

    <a href="/zoom.php?shots/fluxbox/remember_patch.jpg"><img src="/images/shots/fluxbox/remember_patch-.jpg" border=0 align=right vspace=10 hspace=10 title="Remember Patch"></a>
    Xavier Brouckaert made some time ago a <a href="/download/patches/unofficial-fluxbox-0.1.12-remember-patch.bz2">patch</a> which enabled Fluxbox (v0.1.10) to remember and restore
    application settings like position, size, workspace, decorations, tab style... and so on.<br>
    This patch was also available for v0.1.11 and because of <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/fluxbox-users">users requst</a>,
    it is now available also for the latest v0.1.12 release.<br>
    This patch adds 2 features:
    <blockquote>
        1) Ability to launch applications at fluxbox startup via a submenu called 'Startup' in the menu file. It's useful for those using gdm as login manager (without .xsession).
        <br><br>

        2) Remembering of workspace, dimensions, position and other parameters via a new submenu called 'Remember...' when you right click on the titlebar of a window. Window settings are saved in a new file "~/.fluxbox/apps".
    </blockquote>
    Read the instruction and grab it on the <a href="/download.php#patches">download page</a>.
    <br>
    <b>NOTICE:</b> Do not disable tabs in Fluxbox configuration, cause you will get lots of crushes when you try to move tabs around.
    You can still disable tabs for given applications and do not notice crushes when you have tabs enabled in Fluxbox.

  title: Artwiz Fonts and locale settings - the solution
  author: aleczapka
  content: |+
    I think all of you know very well done fonts made by artwiz. Especially they look great with Fluxbox, the only problem was when somebody wanted to use some different encoding (locale settings) then C or POSIX they didn't show up.<br>
    We had some way to fix it but it was just a 'patch'. Sometime ago I was able to solve this problem pernamently and in a proper way.
    You can read more on updated <a href="/docs/en/artwiz-fonts.php#localefix">Artwiz-fonts HOWTO</a>.<br>
    Note: This will help you to fix this issue not just with Fluxbox but with other applications as well (eg. evolution and UTF-8).

  content: |+
    We decided to move <a href="/themes.php">themes</a> section - there is no need to double the location of the themes,
    and it will speed things up.<br>
    <b>Please submit all your beautiful themes at <a href="http://themes.freshmeat.net/browse/962/">Freshmeat.net</a> from now on.</b>
    The themes which have been submitted already will stay here, but we don't accept new submissions anymore.

    For quite a while, there is a lot going on at our <a href="http://www.geocrawler.com/lists/3/SourceForge/18605/0/">fluxbox-devel</a> mailing list.<br>
    In a secret can tell ya, ppl are submitting patches like crazy... damn, how sweet :><br>
    Some of them, got into v0.1.8 already, some are in current CVS, and some didn't make it yet.
    You'd better take a look for yourself, cause you could loose a good chance to try some new,
    really kewl features, like (some of my fav):
    <ul>
    	<li><a href="http://www.geocrawler.com/lists/3/SourceForge/18605/0/8531463/">move tabs, etc</a><br>
    	<i>"Ok, after a suggestion from Rando, I renamed the functions in my
    	patch to be a little more generic and not so horizontal-tabs
    	specific (MoveTabPrev, MoveTabNext instead of MoveTabRight and
    	MoveTabLeft). For those that don't remember, these two binds
    	allow you to swap the focused tab with either the previous or next
    	tab in the list, allowing you to move the tabs around in the list
    	without touching the mouse."</i>
    	<br>
    	Author: Phil Dier | phil at gettcomm.com
    	<br><br>

    	<li><a href="http://www.geocrawler.com/lists/3/SourceForge/18605/0/8524524/">operate menus with keyboard</a><br>
    	<i>
    	"RootMenu' key binding is very useful, but I want to do all menu
    	operation with keyboard. I have a try to implement this feature.
    	With the patch at the end, you can use following bindings in your keys file (...)"

    	<li><a href="http://www.geocrawler.com/lists/3/SourceForge/18605/0/8515478/">Sorted slit dockapps</a><br>
    	<i>
    	"This patch addresses the unpredictability of slit dockapp ordering.
    	It stores the current order of dockapps in a file,
    	default=~/.fluxbox/slitlist.  When loading dockapps into the slit it
    	attempts to maintain the previous ordering, matching with
    	previously-run dockapps by name."

    To apply the patch, use:

    X-mas time, so we have a few gifts for all Fluxbox fr34ks out there - bunch of new <a href="/themes.php">themes</a> contributed by FluxFans.
    <a href="/themes.php">Check</a> them out.<br>
    Thx all for submitting.<br>
    I keep working on some nice scripts which will make theme submitting/browsing easier for you and us,
    so till the scripts are not ready I will not upload new themes, however you can still send them over.

    Finally we have someone who will be dedicated to provide some good fluxbox documentation!<BR> The guy is <a href="mailto:stantoncook@ozemail.com.au">dyclops</A> and his first project will probably be a doc on "non-blackbox things" in fluxbox - thanks a lot for helping out.

  title: Bbtools bugfix
  author: aleczapka
  content: |+
    Yup, for all of you who got problems using bbtools with v0.1.5 Henrik has prepared <a href="/download/patches/fluxbox-0.1.5.bbtools-buggfix1.patch">patch</a>, so grab it, apply, recompile and keep everybody telling that fluxbox rox :).
    <blockquote>
    <code>patch -p0 < fluxbox-0.1.5.buggfix1.patch</code>
    </blockquote>

    Put the patch in the parent directory where you keep your fluxbox sources,
    e.g. <code>/usr/src/fluxbox-0.1.5</code> so the patch should go into <code>/usr/src/</code>.

    We have a few new <a href="/themes.php">themes</a> for you, so check it out. They are not included with Fluxbox because they are quite big all together (background pics).<br>
    Themes section should be fully opened in the next week, so in a meantime keep sending your fluxbox styles.<br>
    And if you didn't notice we got a bunch of new <a href="/screenshots.php">screenshots</a> already. Thanks all who submitted them.

  title: Fluxbox v0.1.5. is out!
  author: Henrik
  content: |+
    0.1.5 is finally here! major code updates, a couple of new features.
    All in all another big update for the window manager for powerusers[tm] ;)
    Please note that the "tab-placement":/features/tabs.php code is still rather beta, so expect it to be better/more stable in the next release.
    And as usual, take a peek in the "ChangeLog":/changelog.php for all the delicious new stuff.
    By the way to convert your old bbkeys conf-files (.bbkeysrc) to fluxbox new keygrabber's syntax, get "this":/download/convertkeys or "this":/download/convertkeys2 script (both do the same thing) or read this little "description":/docs/fbgrab.php.
